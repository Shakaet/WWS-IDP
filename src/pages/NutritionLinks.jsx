            Nutrition Links is an outreach program designed to improve the health and well-being 
            of individuals and families with limited resources. By offering free, research-based 
            nutrition education, the program empowers participants to make healthier food choices, 
            manage food budgets, and reduce food insecurity.  

            Classes cover topics like healthy meal planning, food safety, smart shopping, and 
            increasing fruit and vegetable intake. Lessons are interactive, practical, and 
            culturally relevant, ensuring that families can apply what they learn in their daily lives.  

            With the support of Penn State Extension educators and community partners, Nutrition Links 
            helps thousands of Pennsylvanians develop lifelong skills for healthier living, while also 
            addressing broader issues of food security and public health.
