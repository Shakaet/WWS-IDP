            The Penn State Master Gardeners Program equips volunteers with the knowledge and 
            skills needed to promote best practices in gardening, landscaping, and 
            environmental stewardship.  

            Participants receive in-depth training in horticulture, botany, pest management, 
            pollinator health, soil science, and more. Once certified, Master Gardeners 
            extend research-based education to the public by leading workshops, answering 
            gardening questions, and supporting community projects.  

            From creating pollinator-friendly habitats to advising on sustainable lawn care, 
            Master Gardeners make a meaningful difference by helping individuals and 
            communities thrive in harmony with nature.
